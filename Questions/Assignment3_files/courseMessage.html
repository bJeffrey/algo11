<h2 align="center">Programming Assignment 3</h2>

<p></p><h3 align="center">Realization of a Spell Checker Using AVL Trees</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you prepare height-balanced trees in order to store
a dictionary of words. Assume that we are dealing with a language called
Funglish for which a <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/%7Eabhij/course/theory/Algo1/Autumn11/lab/wordlist.txt">word list</a> is provided.
For simplicity, we assume that Funglish has only two- to eight-letter
words. The <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/%7Eabhij/course/theory/Algo1/Autumn11/lab/wordlist.txt">word-list file</a> contains these
words in a random order and with repetitions. Funglish is case-insensitive,
so you do not need to worry about distinguishing between lower and upper
cases. Work consistently with upper-case letters.

</p><p></p><h3 align="left">Creating the AVL trees</h3>
<p>Read the word list from the <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/%7Eabhij/course/theory/Algo1/Autumn11/lab/wordlist.txt">supplied file</a>,
and for each <i>i</i> in the range [2,8], store all <i>i</i>-letter words
in an AVL tree <i>T</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>. Your dictionary is stored
as a collection of the seven trees <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>3</sub>,
<tt>...</tt>, <i>T</i><sub>8</sub>. You may use the following data types
to store the dictionary.
</p><pre>   typedef struct _treenode {
      char *word;
      struct _treenode *left;
      struct _treenode *right;
      struct _treenode *parent;
      int balancefactor;
   } AVLtreenode;

   typedef AVLtreenode *AVLtree;

   typedef AVLtree *dictionary;
</pre>

<p>This is a kind of hashed AVL forest, where an initial hashing is done
with respect to the lengths of the words. Initially, create seven empty
trees. Subsequently, as you read the word-list file, insert each word in
the appropriate tree based upon the length of the word. Use a <i>single</i>
function for insertion in an AVL tree.

</p><p>This is a static dictionary, and sorted arrays could have served our
purpose. But this exercise is meant for playing with height-balanced
trees. In this exercise, you never delete any word from the dictionary, so
there is no need to write the deletion function for AVL trees.

</p><p>After the entire word-list is read, compute and report the heights
of all the seven trees.

</p><p>Using the following command, you can sort the word-list file,
remove duplicates from it, and store the list in a file <tt>wordlist-sorted-nodup.txt</tt>.
</p><pre>   $ sort wordlist.txt | uniq &gt; wordlist-sorted-nodup.txt
</pre>
<p>Build the seven trees using this processed word-list file, and report the
heights of the seven trees. It is very interesting to note that if the items
input to an AVL tree appear in the sorted order, the result is a <i>perfectly
balanced</i> binary search tree. Try to prove this assertion as a theoretical
exercise (not for submission).

</p><p></p><h3 align="left">Spell Checking</h3>
<p>Generate a random (purportedly Funglish) word with the following constraints.
</p><ul>
<li>The length of the word is randomly chosen between two and eight (both inclusive).
</li><li>A letter in the word is chosen according to the following probability
distribution. The relative frequencies of the different letters (in a total
of 100) are provided in the table below.
<center>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td> E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>H</td><td>I</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td><td>M</td><td>N</td><td>O</td><td>P</td><td>Q</td><td>R</td><td>S</td><td>T</td><td>U</td><td>V</td><td>W</td><td>X</td><td>Y</td><td>Z
</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>
</li><li>Two consecutive vowels or two consecutive consonants occur relatively
infrequently.
</li></ul>

<p>Search the word generated in your dictionary. If the word is found, do
nothing. Otherwise, generate spell-correcting suggestions. There are four
groups of words that are suggested.
</p><ul>
<li><b>Group 1:</b> Delete any one letter from the given word.
</li><li><b>Group 2:</b> Add one letter at any position of the given word.
</li><li><b>Group 3:</b> Change any single letter of the given word.
</li><li><b>Group 4:</b> Swap any two letters of the given word.
</li></ul>
<p>Report all the suggested words that are present in the dictionary.

</p><p></p><h3 align="left">Destroy the Dictionary</h3>
<p>After the spell-checking work is done, destroy the dictionary. This means
that any dynamic memory allocated to store the dictionary is to be freed.
This includes the memory associated with the char array in each node (field
<tt>word</tt> in data type <tt>AVLtreenode</tt>), the memory associated
with each node (allocated to the <tt>left</tt> or <tt>right</tt> pointer of
some node), and also the memory associated with the array of seven tree
headers (data type <tt>dictionary</tt>).

</p><p></p><h3 align="left">Sample Output</h3>
Present your output as in the following format.
<pre>   Height of D[2] = 9
   Height of D[3] = 11
   ...
   Height of D[8] = 22
